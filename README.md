# CSI_Self-Quarantine_Monitoring

This repository provides code for CSI based self-quarantine monitoring using branchy CNN. This work won the champion in Hong Kong Electronic Project Competition. The related paper has been accepted (8th WF-IoT 2022). And I have prepared a [Pi 4B image and raw CSI Dataset](https://connectpolyu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/20088334g_connect_polyu_hk/EuokbV2ryK5DqpnZeC1N0jQBCMYdOaoMnHm-VGCuwr_Rog?e=Wixttt) (Link_Password: WFiotNov,2022) for easily installing the Pi system with nexmon patch. Feel free to access it!
