# CSI_Self-Quarantine_Monitoring

This repository provides code for CSI based self-quarantine monitoring using branchy CNN. This work won the champion in Hong Kong Electronic Project Competition. The related paper has been accepted (8th WF-IoT 2022). And I have prepared a [Pi 4B image](https://connectpolyu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/20088334g_connect_polyu_hk/EdewOzSC44xIqiVQyGO-LucB0hEgskWE7iTwnBP5oAH7Yw?e=AHF4lo
) (Password: polyuEIE,22) for easily installing the Pi system with nexmon patch. Feel free to access it!
